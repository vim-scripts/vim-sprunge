There are several pastebin sites avalaible on the Internet, and there exist even a plugin for Gist: https://github.com/mattn/gist-vim. So why yet another pastebin plugin?, well, tell me 1 site who allow you fetch the content sanetely?, most of them ask you to open a browser and click here and there to get the juice.

http://sprunge.us/ doesn't not!, if you're confident in a terminal, try this:

  $ ls | curl -F 'sprunge=<-' http://sprunge.us

Curius for your output?, try now this:

  $ curl <url-sprunge-generated>

Cool!?, eh?, now, wouldn't it be even more cool if you could paste directly from vim?

2. Usage

    :Sprunge

After pressing <Enter>, you'll get a url with the content of your file. You
can also invoke this in visual mode to sprunge only the visual selection.

Alternatively you may also use the '<Leader>s' mapping, you can override this
mapping by setting 'g:sprunge_map' in your .vimrc
