There are several pastebin sites avalaible on the Internet, and there exist even a plugin for Gist: https://github.com/mattn/gist-vim

So why yet another pastebin plugin?, well, tell me 1 site who allow you fetch the content sanetely?, most of them ask you to open a browser and click here and there to get the juice.

http://sprunge.us/ doesn't not!, if you're confident in a terminal, try this:

  $ ls | curl -F 'sprunge=<-' http://sprunge.us

Curius for your output?, try now this:

  $ curl <url-sprunge-generated>

Yep, reasonable simple!?, now, suppose you're working on a script, you want to test it in a pristine env, maybe ec2 or vagrant...

  $ cat script | curl -F 'sprunge=<-' http://sprunge.us

And then from the pristine environment:

  $ bash <(wget -qO- <url-sprunge-generated>)

Cool!?, eh?, now, wouldn't it be cool if you could paste directly from vim?


2. Usage

If by now you're in love with http://sprunge.us/, you can start using it with:

    :Sprunge

And press <Enter>, you'll get a url with the content of your file. If you find yourself typing ':Sprunge' too often you can add a shortcut:

    nnoremap <F11> :Sprunge<CR>
